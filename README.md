# samples-web-app
Our company's web application to replace Microsoft Access.

Migrated our Microsoft Access file, for fabrication samples sent out by our company, to SQL Server. This web application pulls data from an ERP system's API then populates tables in the SQL Server database using PHP. The tables are mutable in the web application. I am hosting the web application using XAMPP (Apache) locally on our network.
